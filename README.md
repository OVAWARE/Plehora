## How to install this on computercraft

Note: This assumes the repo is cloned on the root of your computer, please change your paths accordingly.

### 1. Install Github Repo Downloader

this will add the github program and it's rom to the computer

```sh
pastebin run p8PJVxC4
```

I also have the habit to alias github as git as such:

```sh
alias git github
```

### 2. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone OVAWARE/Plehora
```
